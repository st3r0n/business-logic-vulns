1. exessive trust on client side
look for anything that we can control

2. failing to handle unconventional input (like usning negative numbers)

3. low level logic like handling of int typeusers  by the server

4 making falwed assumptiona bout user behaviour

5.users won't always supply mandatory input   ---> someimes if we don't provide mandatory inout it can strihght through bypass the security controls


6.Users won't always follow the intended sequence
sometimes one stepis completed and another step is required to be followed but the user can skip that sequence to bypass access controls


7.Providing an encryption oracle
when user can encrypt arbitrary input directly provided to server 
this can expose the encryption used and we can use this type of logic flaw to extarct useful info to gain admin access
